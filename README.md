## Project created in Python

It is a simple simulation of a pendulum in which you can adjust it's *weight*, *length* and it's *initial angle*.

#### Installation
Simply clone the repository and open the executable in the *dist* folder.

#### Short example

![[Pendulum1.png]]
1. Using the top slider you can adjust the *mass* (in kg).
2. Using the bottom slider you can adjust the pendulum's *length* (in cm).
3. In the bottom-right corner you can see the current *angle* (in radians).
4. **To input an angle you simply type it (in degrees) and then press *Enter***, you will see the number you input as you type it.
5. Pressing *r* angles the pendulum at a 45Â° angle.
6. Pressing *o* stops the pendulum's movement completely.
